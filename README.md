# E-Sploit
Neat and small JJSploit inspired executor

## IMPORTANT! The run file "Esploit.exe" is inside Esploit/bin/x64/Debug/net8.0-windows

Pros:

- A lot of scripts used by JJSploit
- Button System similar to JJSploits
- Completely open source
- Free and Keyless
- idk what else to add here
- Simple yet sleek design
- Automatically recognizes the Roblox Client and injects (most of the time)

Cons:
- Jump Power change doesn't work (i think) because I was too dumb and lazy to add that somehow
- Script editor has neither syntax clarifications nor error checking.
