# E-Sploit
Neat and small JJSploit inspired executor

## IMPORTANT! This Executor will possibly be flagged as a virus by your antivirus, because this executor, just like every other executor needs to inject a DLL inside of roblox, for the script to work inside of Roblox.
## Only download the things you trust! This program is completely open source so you can check for yourself, if this program is reliable to you or not. Stay cautious downloading Executors!

This executor works on Salad API and I am NOT the creator of Salad API. I am the one that created this executor, the design, and the functions of the design using Salad API.

Pros:

- A lot of scripts used by JJSploit
- Button System similar to JJSploits
- Completely open source
- Free and Keyless
- idk what else to add here
- Simple yet sleek design
- Automatically recognizes the Roblox Client and injects (most of the time)

Cons:
- Jump Power change doesn't work (i think) because I was too dumb and lazy to add that somehow
- Script editor has neither syntax clarifications nor error checking.
